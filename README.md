# Cyberpunk 2077 Web Redesign
Web concept for Cyberpunk 2077's main website.
The design includes a home page, a page dedicated
for media including the 'Night City Wire' episodes,
a 'Screenshots' section for showcasing in-game visuals
and a 'Wallpapers' section to display visuals and downloadable
content.
Designed in Adobe XD, and several assets were created using Adobe Photoshop.
